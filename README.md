# gmython
Python library for generating GMAT scripts and ingesting data from GMAT

## Why gmython?

This library augments [NASA's General Missiona Analysis Tool](https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/capabilities/capabilities-listing/general-mission-analysis-tool-gmat/) with two main capabilities:
- The ability to procedurally generate GMAT mission scripts using Python
- The automatic injestion of GMAT data into Python

These capabilites can be used to run optimizations, parametric analyses, and automated data analytics. 

## Setup

1. [Download and install GMAT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/files/GMAT/)
2. Ensure the GMATConsole executable can be found in the PATH environment variable

## Usage

See the [examples](./examples) folder for script samples
